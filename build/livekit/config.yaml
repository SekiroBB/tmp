# main TCP port for RoomService and RTC endpoint
# for production setups, this port should be placed behind a load balancer with TLS
port: 7880

  # UDP ports to use for client traffic.
  # this port range should be open for inbound traffic on the firewall
  # when set, LiveKit enable WebRTC ICE over TCP when UDP isn't available
  # this port *cannot* be behind load balancer or TLS, and must be exposed on the node
  # WebRTC transports are encrypted and do not require additional encryption
  # only 80/443 on public IP are allowed if less than 1024
  # when set to true, attempts to discover the host's public IP via STUN
  # this is useful for cloud environments such as AWS & Google where hosts have an internal IP
  # that maps to an external one
